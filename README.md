## Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, made to be used on macOS. But they may work on Linux? Idk.

I took inspiration from 
 - https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles
 - https://github.com/mattjmorrison/dotfiles/
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs

```
git clone https://github.com/se-bastiaan/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles/
bash setup.sh
```

If you want to setup SSH:

```
bash ssh_init.ssh <name>
```
